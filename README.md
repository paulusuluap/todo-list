# 📌 To-Do List App

A sleek and efficient To-Do List application built with **React** to help users manage their tasks effortlessly. This project demonstrates my skills in front-end development, state management, and UI/UX design.

## 🚀 Features

- ✅ **Add, Edit, and Delete Tasks** – Easily manage your to-dos with a smooth user interface.
- ✅ **Mark Tasks as Completed** – Keep track of completed and pending tasks.
- ✅ **Local Storage Persistence** – Saves tasks even after refreshing the page.
- ✅ **Responsive Design** – Fully optimized for mobile and desktop screens.
- ✅ **User-friendly UI** – Minimalistic and intuitive design for seamless experience.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **React.js** – Component-based UI development
- **Hooks (useState, useEffect)** – State and side-effect management
- **CSS** – Styling and responsive design, I used fanta.css created by smoljames [here](https://github.com/jamezmca/fantacss)
- **Local Storage API** – Data persistence
